                <p>Welcome to the dungeon. You have been sent down to this dungeon to do one job. Find the treasure hidden deep within but most of the paths will lead to a ‘GAME OVER’. There is however a couple of ways out but you want to leave with the treasure and nothing else will do. You have only one shot so be careful and GOOD LUCK.</p>
