# Code Bootcamp Week Three/Four Assignment: Create a javascript game.

This repositiory contains my third assignment of code bootcamp. We were required to create a game using javascript. This assignment has been spilt over two weeks. This first week we are focusing on the logic and the words of the game. On week four we will work on the visual look of the game. This is my second attempt at this assignment. My first attempt is also on Github. This week we have been working on the basics of Javascript. This includes learning about variable, if/which statements, logic operators, working with chrome developer tools and other topics.
